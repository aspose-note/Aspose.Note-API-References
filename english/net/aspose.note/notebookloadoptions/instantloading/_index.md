## NotebookLoadOptions.InstantLoading property

Gets or sets a value indicating whether children documents should be loaded while the parent document is loading.

```csharp
public bool InstantLoading { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Default value is `false`, so child documents will be loaded "lazily", i.e. their loading should be postponed until a direct access to specific child. Value `true` is indicating that their loading should be done immediately.
