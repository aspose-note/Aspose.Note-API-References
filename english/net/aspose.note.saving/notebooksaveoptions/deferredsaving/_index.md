## NotebookSaveOptions.DeferredSaving property

Gets or sets a value indicating whether children documents should be saved explicitly.

```csharp
public bool DeferredSaving { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Default value is `false`, so child documents will be saved implicitly. Value `true` is indicating that user should save each notebook's child node explicitly. If notebook is saving to stream, the value is always `true` despite was explicitly set by user to `false`.
